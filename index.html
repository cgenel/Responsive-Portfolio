      <p>Hello welcome to the rough draft of my portfolio! I am a new and aspiring developer in the works. Currently just starting out, 
        but give me some time and this will fill out quite nicely! At the moment I am unsure what I would like to specialize in specifically, but 
        I am excited to see how far I can go!</p>

      <p>Lately I have really enjoyed going out to some local parks with disc golf courses and throwing a round or two at least once a week. It has 
        been a fun hobby, and was actually pretty challenging to learn. I also enjoy playing video games a lot, definitely my favorite thing to do on my free time.</p>

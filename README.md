# Responsive-Portfolio
> My first attempt at enhancing my portfolio with a mobile-responsive layout!

## Table of Contents
* About me page with a little info about myself
* Contact page if you care to get a hold of me
* Portfolio page so you can admire my work :)

## General Info
Well I have to say my time managemnet this past week was terrible and I did
not put in as much time as I should/could have to finish on time.

To-do- list:
*I need to use three '@media screen' tags, each with their own width of 980px, 780px, or 640px
*980px because desktop layout is 960px wide
*780px is the width of most Tablets and 640px is the width of a phone in landscape.

##Status
Project is: _in progress_
